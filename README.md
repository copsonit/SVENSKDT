# SVENSKDT
Application for Atari Falcon 030 that installs swedish desktop and keyboard. 

This is the source code used for creating the "Svensk Desktop" for Falcon.
It was developed by Copson DATA, Sweden and sold to the Swedish distributor
for Atari at that time, AdAstra AB, and was delivered with all Swedish
sold Atari Falcons during about 1994-1995 until AdAstra AB stopped trading.

It is release to public domain 2020 by me, Conny Pettersson, as the developer
of the software.

The repo will try to recreate the development cycle as well as the commits should
be in the order the files were originally created by changing the last file
number and thus keeping a history of the files.
